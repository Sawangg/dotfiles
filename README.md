# Sawang's dotfiles

This is my dotfiles repository containing all of my configs. I tried to achieve a consistent workflow for development as well as trying to be the perfect blend between useful, secure and pretty. Here is a list of features:

- Based on `Arch Linux` providing recent packages release
- Minimalist & terminal focused, everything you need is inside the terminal
- Keyboard centric, code fast using the power of good mappings
- Full support for different keyboard layouts (`qwerty` & `azerty`)
- Consistent theme across all apps with soothing colors to limit eye strain
- Compatible with `systemd` free distros like `Artix Linux`

Install every dotfiles and my bash config by running
